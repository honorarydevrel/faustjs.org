# faustjs.org (work in progress)

Frontend for the [faustjs.org](https://faustjs.org/) website.

## Linting and Formatting

Linting - checks for potential errors and code style. i.e. eslint
Formatting - checks for spaces, line length, etc. i.e prittier

Both are run agaist staged files on commit. If it's failing for a good reaason and you need to bypass you can use the `--no-verify` or `-n` flag. `git commit -nm "my message"`
