Faust's `blockset` command deploys Faust.js blocks to your backend WordPress site so they may be used in the Block Editor. This reference page lists the prerequisites and usage instructions for the `blockset` command.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the `blockset` command, you will need the following.

### Packages and Plugins

These NPM packages installed:

- `@faustwp/cli`
- `@wordpress/scripts`

These WordPress plugins installed and activated:

- [Faust.js WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/)
- [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
- [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks)

### A Created Block

Before syncing a block to your WordPress backend site, you must of course have a block created.

If you don't have a block already created, you can use the official [@wordpress/create-block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/) package to scaffold out a new block inside a directory named `wp-blocks` within your Next.js app.

```
wp-blocks
├── block-a
│   ├── block.json
│   ├── edit.js
│   ├── editor.scss
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── save.js
│   └── style.scss
└── index.js
```

> [!NOTE]
> See our [React Components to Blocks](/docs/how-to/custom-blocks/) how-to guide for more information on how to create React components that can be used as blocks in the Block Editor.

## `blockset` Command Usage

The `blockset` command can be run by adding `faust blockset` to one or more of your `package.json` scripts, then running those scripts from the command line.

This example is utilizing npm pre-hooks to automatically execute the blockset process whenever `npm run dev` or `npm run build` are run:

```json title="package.json"
{
	"scripts": {
		"predev": "faust blockset", // [!code ++]
		"dev": "faust dev",
		"prebuild": "faust blockset", // [!code ++]
		"build": "faust build"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"@faustwp/cli": "^1.2.1",
		"@wordpress/scripts": "26.18.0"
	}
}
```

With that code in place, each time a developer runs `npm run dev` or `npm run build`, the `blockset` command will be executed, syncing the blocks within the `wp-blocks` folder to your WordPress backend.

## Example App

To see a working example of an app that has been configured to use the `blockset` command, see our block-support example app, here:

https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary/examples/next/block-support

If you'd like, you can clone this example app and run it locally with this command:

```bash
npx create-next-app \
-e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary \
--example-path examples/next/block-support \
--use-npm
```
