};

In headless WordPress with Faust.js, the template router offers a powerful way to dynamically map WordPress pages and posts to specific templates, streamlining how content is fetched and rendered. When working with WordPress block data, the template router allows you to efficiently map block types to React components, giving you greater control over how individual blocks are rendered within each template.

This guide walks you through rendering native WordPress core blocks using the template router.

## 0. Basic Setup

If you don't already have a working Faust.js site, follow the [Basic Setup](/docs/how-to/basic-setup/) to get Faust.js set up.

## 1. Setup WPGraphQL Content Blocks Plugin

### A. Download the WPGraphQL Content Blocks Plugin

To set up the [WPGraphQL Content Blocks plugin](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) on the WP backend. Head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) and download the [latest version](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/releases/latest/download/wp-graphql-content-blocks.zip) of the `wp-graphql-content-blocks` plugin from the releases tab.

### B. Upload the Plugin

Upload the plugins `.zip` file to your WordPress site via the plugins page or unzip and copy the file contents into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins` folder manually.

### C. Activate the plugin

Activate the plugin on the WordPress plugins page.

## 2. Render Blocks from the @faust/blocks package

The `@faust/blocks` package contains a small reference list of core blocks that you can use in your site.

> [!TIP]
> These blocks are provided as a quick start option and reference. Blocks can be customized to fit your site's needs. Check out the [Custom Blocks](/docs/how-to/custom-blocks/) guide for more information on how to create custom blocks.

### A. Install the @faust/blocks package

```bash
npm install @faustwp/blocks
```

### B. Import Block Components

To use them, you need to import the relevant blocks into your `wp-blocks/index.js` block list:

```js title="wp-blocks/index.js"
import { CoreBlocks } from "@faustwp/blocks";

export default {
	...CoreBlocks,
};
```

### C. Import Fragments

Then in your template queries, you will need to pass the provided fragment entries. here's an example of how to do that using the `front-page` template:

```js title="wp-templates/front-page.js"
import blocks from "../wp-blocks";

Component.query = gql`
  ${blocks.CoreParagraph.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreColumns.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreColumn.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreCode.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreButtons.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreButton.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreQuote.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreImage.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreSeparator.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreList.fragments.entry}
  ${blocks.CoreHeading.fragments.entry}
  query GetPage(
    $databaseId: ID!
    $asPreview: Boolean = false
  ) {
    page(id: $databaseId, idType: DATABASE_ID, asPreview: $asPreview) {
      title
      content
      editorBlocks {
        name
        __typename
        renderedHtml
        id: clientId
        parentId: parentClientId
        ...${blocks.CoreParagraph.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreColumns.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreColumn.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreCode.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreButtons.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreButton.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreQuote.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreImage.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreSeparator.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreList.fragments.key}
        ...${blocks.CoreHeading.fragments.key}
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### D. Rendering Blocks

Now that you have all the queries ready, you can render the blocks using the provided `flatListToHierarchical` method and `WordPressBlocksViewer`:

```js {2-4, 12,13,18} title="wp-templates/front-page.js"
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";
import { flatListToHierarchical } from "@faustwp/core";
import { WordPressBlocksViewer } from "@faustwp/blocks";
import blocks from "../wp-blocks";

export default function Component({ loading, data }) {
	// Loading state for previews.
	if (loading) {
		return <>Loading...</>;
	}

	const { title, editorBlocks } = data?.page ?? { title: "" };
	const blockList = flatListToHierarchical(editorBlocks, {
		childrenKey: "innerBlocks",
	});

	return (
		<div className="is-layout-constrained">
			<h1>{title}</h1>
			<WordPressBlocksViewer blocks={blockList} />
		</div>
	);
}
```

## 3. ALl done!

run `npm run dev` and navigate to your front page to see the blocks rendered!
