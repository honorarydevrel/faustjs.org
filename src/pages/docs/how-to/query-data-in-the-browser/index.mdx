export const metadata = {
    title: "Query Data in the Browser",

}

When you query data in the browser, you’re leveraging Apollo’s `useQuery` hook within your React components. This is client-side data fetching, which means the data is fetched after your page renders in the browser **_(rather than at build time or request time on the server)_**.

## Steps

### 1. Basic setup

If you haven't already, follow the [Basic Setup](/docs/how-to/basic-setup/) steps to get Faust.js set up.

## Using the client in components and pages

You can use the client as usual in your components and pages. Take the following example of querying the `title` and `description` from `generalSettings` in your app:

```js {12-18} title="page/SamplePage.js"
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

export default function Page(props) {
  const { data } = useQuery(Page.query);
  const { title, description } = data.generalSettings;
  return(
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{description}</p>
  )
}

Page.query = gql`
  query {
    generalSettings {
      title
      description
    }
  }
`
```

It co-locates the GraphQL query within the same file. You can also import and use queries from a file.

The benefit with Faust is that you don’t have to create the client object in your codebase. It is automatically created when you first import the `@faustwp-core package`. Instead you can customize it by using a plugin filter.

> **NOTE**  
> This data is not server-rendered. Since it is fetched at runtime in the user’s browser, it may have performance implications if the query is large or slow.
