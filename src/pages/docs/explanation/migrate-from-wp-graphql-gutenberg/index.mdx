In this guide we provide a list of recommended steps to migrate any blocks you have developed from the wp-graphql-gutenberg plugin to the wp-graphql-content-blocks plugin.

## What is wp-graphql-gutenberg?

As explained, it’s an extension for WPGraphQL that adds the blocks to the WPGraphQL schema just like the `wp-graphql-content-blocks`.

However there are some key differences that you need to be aware of:

- WPGraphQL Gutenberg gets the blocks registry and sends it in a network request to the WordPress PHP application. So it needs to be synced from time to time.

- It also allows the blocks to be served as JSON using the `blocksJSON` field. If requesting data this way, the data is not typechecked and you may overfetch data as a side effect.

- Block attributes are using their own types, containing different type for deprecated versions. For example:

```gql
...on CoreParagraphBlock {
    attributes {
        ...on CoreParagraphBlockAttributes {
            content
        }
        ...on CoreParagraphBlockDeprecatedV1Attributes {
            content
        }
    }
}
```

- It does not allow blocks to be returned as a flat list so you have to use deeply nested queries to get the list of innerBlocks (and this won’t nearly solve the issue 100%).

- wp-graphql-content-blocks does not save anything in the database (this is actually a good thing) compared to wp-graphql-gutenberg. Therefore it only supports previews when the **“preview”** button is hit in the editor.
