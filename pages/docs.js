// TODO: Add docs page- But how do we want to do this?
// Do we want to do it with WP being the data source
// and use the templating system with a custom docs template
// or do we want to do it with the Next.js routing system?
//I also think we should consider renaming the CPT's in
// WP Admin and change it to mirror more Next.js
